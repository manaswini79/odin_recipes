    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>A strong Vietnamese iced coffee recipe with sweetened condensed milk. Chilled on ice, this makes an unbeatable Southeast Asian treat. 
        Even those who only take their coffee black will like this.
         Serve it on hot summer days or as an evening treat. We learned this in Vietnam, and now drink almost all our espresso this way.</p>
